### Benchmarking

Task is to plan, setup, execute, and evaluate a small experiment
concerning these three servers:


http://139.59.132.185:8080

http://192.81.216.124:8080

http://128.199.180.131:8080

---------------------

_* Formulate a hypothesis/problem statement about behavior of response
times of these three servers._

_* Plan an experiment, which measures response times of these three servers._

_* Execute the experiment, which measures response times of these three servers._

_* Evaluate your experiment and interpret the measurements and results._

_* Discuss what you are measuring, how you are measuring, and what could
 influence your results., see Peter Sestoft “Microbenchmarks in Java and
 C#” https://www.itu.dk/people/sestoft/papers/benchmarking.pdf for inspiration_

--------------------

Write a document that explains all of the above. That is, that formulates
 your hypothesis, that describes the experiment setup, that describes how
 you executed the experiment, that explains how to reproduce your
 experiment, and that collects, interprets, and discusses you measurement
 results.
