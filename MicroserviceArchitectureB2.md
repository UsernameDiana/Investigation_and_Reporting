# Microservice Architecture

Monolithic applications are difficult to maintain as they grow.
To achieve an architecture where application is structured as
collections of services will result in a different development process.
By using microservice architecture and thinking of software as
individual modules we can ease the maintenance of the system.
Modularization results in an easy construction and enables the
continuous delivery/deployment of large, complex applications.
