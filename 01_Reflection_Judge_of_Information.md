--------------------------------------------------------------
- List of the 3 most biggest stumbling blocks you came across and your reflection on why they were problematic:

1. The biggest problem I came across was that the LINQPad is only supported on Microsoft and I am using macOS or Linux. Therefor I couldnt install it to access the server with the assignement.
```
You can’t open the application “LINQPad5Setup.exe” because Microsoft Windows applications are not supported on macOS
```

2. It was difficult to find literature or conversation about the issue from point 1. During my search it kept giving LINQ documentation from Microsoft. There was few hits in Stack overflow, but mostly about running Linque file.

--------------------------------------------------------------

### _Conclusion:_

* _A brief “every 30 min” diary as explained in the slides (this is more frequent than one would normally do, and is just meant as part of the exercise)_

First half an hour I have spent on reading the assignement, creating git repo and then realising I cant install LINQ. Therefor I am entering the next 30min of looking into if its possible to get it on OS or Linux.

Just reading about LINQ and what is possible to do with it as i cant still install it on my machine.

Still unable to install LINQ. trying to find some sources about the issue isnt easy. I keep on getting LINQ explanation and usage guides.

* _Brief summary of which aspect of the exercise was taking the longest time to solve._

The longest time was spent on reading LINQ documentation to understand the programm and read sample code.

* _What was the most helpful information?_

Most helpfull information I found on Microsoft homepage where it was the oficial LINQ documentation. Also youtube has some good videos explaining and demoing the programm.

* _How can you avoid those problems in the future, and how can the helpful ressources help you in the future?_

In the future, I would like to team up with a classmate that has different operating system, so atleast one of us could run the programm and we could togeather solve the assignement and discuss obsticles in the way. I think report done in team can produce great discussions and arguments.
