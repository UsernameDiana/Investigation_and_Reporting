### Prototyping, Evaluation, and Documentation

##### 1. https://medium.com/@tschundeee/express-vs-flask-vs-go-acc0879c2122

_* What is the question that the authors try to answer?_

Which language/framework has the fastest response time on handling requests: Node Express vs Python Flask vs Go vs Sparkjava vs Ruby Sinatra

_* What is their hypothesis/problem statement?_

To test/find out the best computing performance for making web server.

_* Do they present an experiment with one or more prototypes?_

He uses one prototype/experiment where he applies the same Fibonacci calculation on each language.

_* Are their experiments reproducible?_

Yes, it is, he has shared his code implementation on his git repository. So, I could clone the code and run it on my machine.

_* Are the presented results understandable?_

Yes, but I would like better explanation of the result table, as it is not clear with just the request numbers and time given.
EX:
```
1a. Golang + bmizerany Pat + GOMAXPROCS(7):
51684 Requests/sec => 1550508 requests in 30s
```

_* How convincing are the drawn conclusions?_

He is not giving too much of an explanations and reasons for this experiment as well as more in dept, explanation on decisions for the languages and web frameworks used. But overall feeling I got that, he knows his goal.

_* What is the question that the authors try to answer?_

Why Flask Might Be Better then Django.

_* What is their hypothesis/problem statement?_

If you decide you want to build a web application, and you would like to develop it in Python, you'll probably want a so-called web framework. Hypothesis is to consider which framework to use when developing application.

_* Do they present an experiment with one or more prototypes?_

It more explains how to build a web application similar to tutorial.

_* Are their experiments reproducible?_

No

_* Are the presented results understandable?_

The initial setup for both Django and Flask are more explanatory then comparing benchmarks, so therefor there is no results.

_* How convincing are the drawn conclusions?_

Drawn conclusion is understandable and convincing, but rather simple, i wish there was more challenging experiments or in this case, comparesments.
